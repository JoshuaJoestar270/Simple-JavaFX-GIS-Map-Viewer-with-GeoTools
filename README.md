# Simple-JavaFX-GIS-Map-Viewer-with-GeoTools
Created a 2D vector map viewer application using JavaFX for the UI and GeoTools library for GIS data handling.
Loaded and rendered a shapefile (e.g., Natural Earth countries boundary data) as vector features.
Applied SLD (Styled Layer Descriptor) styling for visualization, displayed the map in a JMapPane embedded via SwingNode.
Set up map content with bounds and renderer for smooth display and interaction.
Showcases ability to work with open-source GIS tools, handle shapefile data sources, apply cartographic styling, and integrate Java-based geospatial libraries into a modern JavaFX desktop application.

Tech Stack: Java, JavaFX, GeoTools (gt-shapefile, gt-swing), SwingNode
